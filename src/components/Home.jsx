        <p>
          I am a passionate Front-End Developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, and UI/UX design. 
          With hands-on experience in building dynamic, responsive web applications, I specialize in crafting seamless and visually appealing user interfaces.

        <p>
          I have worked on full-stack projects using Django and Python, integrating backend functionality with intuitive front-end designs. 
          My expertise extends to prototyping and wireframing using Figma and Adobe XD, ensuring user-centric designs that enhance engagement and usability.
